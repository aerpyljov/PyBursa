The repository contains my project, that I did on PyBursa cources (http://pybursa.com, 23.02-29.04.2015).
It is a course for Junior Python Developer.


To run my project, proceed as follows:

1. Install Python 2.7.6 and Django 1.7.7.

2. Clone my repository. Pay attention, that my branch is 'a_erpylev', not 'master'!

3. Open a terminal and run 'manage.py' from my project by the following command:
    python manage.py runserver

4. Open your browser and go to the following page:
